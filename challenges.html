<p>Frankly, early access isn't going to go away. Minecraft set the trend, and it has a proven level of profitability despite the criticisms. The issue isn't to get rid of it anyway. Early access has a lot of positives, and in some ways, its a form of open source development that can serve to help developers make a better game. No, the challenges facing early access entirely revolve around deadlines and quality control. Early access games need to start dispelling the stereotype of the "eternal early access" game. Thankfully, steps are already being taken towards this being slowly rectified. On Steam alone, the number of early access games in the past few years (that is, games that have left early access and officially released), have shot up. But almost the same number of games remain in early access. This ultimately comes down to the developers being responsible. Deadlines can be set, but more importantly they need to be KEPT. More indie developers need to take it upon themselves to block out and consider both reasonable goals, and reasonable timeframes to complete these goals. I think one thing that could help with this is teaching these developers good project management skills. Even with next year's GDC (Game Developer's Conference), there is a limited number, if any, of courses and workshops that teach indie developers HOW to manage their time. Most developers are not managers after all, they're programmers and artists. Them learning to manage their time would be a boon for both them, and consumers.</p>
<p>I think perhaps time management as a skill will, in the future, take off. The bar for game development has become lower and lower, and as the career of an indie developer becomes more and more viable, so too will the skills needed to succeed in such a field.</p>
<p>The second challenge is that of quality control. This issue, as many will agree, falls to the digital distributors. Many early access games have a reputation of being the same thing: Unfinished zombie survival games. Early access, as some say, is "defined by its worst aspects", but Valve, who controls platforms that enable early access games. Their oversight, or rather, their lack of oversight, is what can enable bad practices. Valve, as the middleman in this situation, ultimately has to be called upon to be the judge of early access that fail. While the ethical implications of Valve holding this power are... many, that's not what we're here to consider. Valve sells these games, they need to put restrictions on them. While something similar was done with a monetary entry fee for Steam Greenlight (Valve's platform to select which games they're going to sell), I think Valve could take an extra step in investigating games that are already on Steam. Taking consumer complaints seriously and holding at least some early access games accountable for their failure to meet deadlines.</p>
