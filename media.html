<p>Major reviewing sites will announce promising early access games, or run articles about lack of user satisfaction with them. For example, Star Citizen has recieved many articles detailing its development process, user feedback, and controversies. However, early access is considered "not finished" by the majority of them. Similar to not-reviewing games in betas, official reviews do not happen until a game is officially out. Many articles are still run on early access games, first impressions and the like. Non-mainstream media, such as Let's Players and Youtube reviewers, look upon early access with disdain. Many times they have specific sections for looking at bad early access games. At the same time, many famous games have gotten their start and popularity through media attention. Some are not impartial, people with early access games use media connections to get attention on them, regardless of their actual status or quality. Because of the large saturation of early acess, low quality games, or games still heavily in development, reviewers and media more often than not cover low-quality games than high quality ones. The very nature of early access games also give the impression of things being unfinished or not entirely put together. Though, obviously this is true.</p>
