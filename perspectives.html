<p>Examining early access and crowdfunding under hedonism can be complicated. Hedonism seeks pleasure above all else, but with early access games and even Kickstarter, any feeling of reward is often delayed. That isn't to say that hedonism is neccesarily all about immediate gratification, there can be long-term and short-term hedonists, though often they overlap. Hedonism as an ethical framework doesn't preclude the possibility of paying for something now to get something later. But then we reach the issues of broken promises or games simply not being completed. In many cases, these games can be a gamble. But hedonism is okay with gambling. Consider Las Vegas, which is universally seen as a den of hedonism. Gambling under hedonism is okay, it's often pleasurable.
However under hedonism (especially ethical hedonism), a developer abandoning a game is NOT okay. They've failed to provide pleasure, or worse, caused pain, to the audience that they disappointed. Their immediate gain and pleasure has come at the cost of a much larger amount of people's pain, which is of course what hedonism seeks to avoid. Early access under hedonism is not a bad thing, it provides immediate gratification, but abusing it and not releasing a game, or not releasing a game with promised features, DOES violate those ethical principles.
