<p>Early access as a concept is split down the middle. While crowdfunding is, despite its shortcomings, generally seen as a good thing, early access is much more divided. Of course, many well-known early access games are seen as failures, or heavily delayed. Most investors are people who subsequently bought the game, donated to crowdfunding, or otherwise supported its development. They ultimately have a level of investment in these games getting developed, and failure to meet goals can lead to disgruntled investors, which further fuels the idea of early access as a scam, not worth it, or similar.</p>
<p>Many early access games on Steam are reviewed poorly because of this. The split between well-reviewed and poorly-reviewed games is close, with poorly-reviewed games edging out slightly over the better-reviewed ones.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many controversies surround more prominent early access games, mostly coming FROM consumer satisfaction (or lack thereof).</p>
Star Citizen's repeated failures to meet deadlines, as well as multiple accusations of misuing funds, have given it an unfortunate reputation as a scam. Admittedly, much of this speculation comes from developer Derek Smart, who, without getting into too many subjective details, has an unfortunate history with almost every single space-simulation developer in existence. Kerbal Space Program encountered controversies when its employees went on strike, citing horrible management. Ultimately that event did not involve early access as a reason, but KSP is an early access game, which unfortunately did not help the stigma. Many more games suffered from similar controversies; Hiveswap, Starforge, Lego Worlds, all in some way suffered from delays or development problems brought on by lack of experienced developers, lack of budget, or generally poor management. In the eyes of consumers, this of course, didn't help things.</p>
