<p>Crowdfunding in just a few short years has been touted by many to be the future of independent game development. When it first came out, it was to be a new age. No longer would be beholden to publishers or time tables! Gamers could make the games they wanted! Unfortunately, the realities of management settled in, and Crowdfunding has led to a string of failures (though not to say they're aren't successes), and nowadays the term is often anathema for many gamers. But why? As both a CSUMB CS student, and someone who has personally seen several crowdfunding projects die out, it's interesting for me to look at the ethical and social reasons behind crowdfunded and early access games, and just WHY they are the way they are..</p>
<p>On this website, I will talk in depth about the issues at hand involving crowdfunding and its derivatives. We will look at the trends that led to its explosion, its failures, and also its advantages. We will see what future crowdfunding has, and the ethical issues regarding Kickstarter terms, and using donations to fund commercial projects.</p>
