<p>My questions to you as readers are now as follows: Put yourself in the shoes of a gamer, but also a consumer. Do you think you should be able to, if you preordered a game, gain access to the development build of it. That is, if you bought a game, do you feel comfortable with seeing into its development, playing each build as the developers do?
Now, as a follow-up question: Say you bought this early access game of yours, and it's been delayed, or did not turn out the way you expected it to. Who do you feel is responsible? Do you as a consumer feel that you have to be more careful, since you did purchase an early-access game. Or do you feel the developer is responsible for this solely, and that you are not encouraging their behavior or delays?
Furthermore, do you think early access is a good idea at all? Would you prefer weekly developer updates or more transparent development, even if it meant you didn't get to actually play the game?
My next question is to you if you were a developer. Similar to the previous question, what would you do? Would you do early access, knowing the stigma towards it? Would you think that you could stay above any greed, or do you feel that you could simply have weekly updates and be transparent in other forms of development?</p>
