<p>Crowdfunding and early access long been around.</p>
<p>Early access especially has existed, open betas and alphas for open source software. These betas have long existed, for example: many online games such as Warhammer Online offered early betas. </p>
<p>Early access as a concept, that is, essentially buying a game and getting access to its in-development, started in early 2009-2010. Most notable, and possibly first early access games were Minecraft and Interstellar Marines.</p>
<p>Minecraft's success lead to many people looking at its business model and using it as a base to develop their business models. Some people felt that Minecraft used the money from early sales to fund later development. In effect, Minecraft could make false promises (which, in many cases, it did), with the idea that once people bought, the developer would have more money to implement those promises.</p>
<p>Minecraft was not neccesarily crowdfunded. The rise of crowdfunded games, at least in terms of their popularity, began with Double Fine Adventure.</p>
<p>Double Fine Studios ran a Kickstarter campaign asking for money to fund a new adventure game. Double Fine was founded by industry veterans, who had a reputation behind them and many famous games.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter got over 3.3 million dollars in funding, shattering records and launching a wave of Kickstarter games.</p> 
<p>Following Double Fine Adventure, notable campaigns included Wasteland 2, Homestuck, Star Citizen, and the Ouya.</p> 
<p>Many of these rewarded backers and had early access promises and features. Many were considered failures, or didn't live up to the promises that were made.</p>
