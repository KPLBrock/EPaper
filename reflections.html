<p>Personally, I think Early Access is a double-edged sword. In the tools of a respectable, responsible developer it can be an amazing way to update fans and followers, as well as lead to better crowdsourced testing and general transparency with the development of one's game. But many developers are not responsible, or do not have experience with deadlines or working on large projects, which leads to unfortunate results. I feel that most people will find Early Access to not work for them, simply because they are inexperienced and won't be able to handle such a workload. I personally, due to my dislike of releasing projects before they're finished, would never use Early Access. At the same time, I feel like developers who don't use early access should nevertheless adopt polices to increase transparency during development. There should be no issue with developers who don't want the public to have access to their internal builds, but there should also be no issue with developers who want to keep the development of things closed in source. The only exception I have to this rule is if said developers previously promised transparency, especially if said developer gained their money via crowdfunding.</p>
